1) What's the price for a John Deere E100 42in 17 HP?
2) Do you offer John Deere white glove delivery service?
3) How much do you charge to service a machine annually? Also regarding service, do you offer pick up and delivery (I don't own a truck, so I can't haul it myself).","1535814660","true","new",
