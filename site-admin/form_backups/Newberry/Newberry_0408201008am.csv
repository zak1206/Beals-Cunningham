I have cancer so I have to make arrangements with others when I'm  ready which should be in a couple of weeks. If things work out, I hope I'll be ready next week but nothing seems to go as planned.

I'll let you know if I need you to get me one.

Thanks,

"8","John","Spencer","7422spencer@gmail.com","7343080232"," I would like to inquire about warranty service on a E110 John Deere lawn tractor.   It is leaking oil and blowing black smoke. I suspect a gasket is not seated properly. The tractor was purchased in September 2018 and has 2.6 hours.   What is the warrantee process? Do you have a trailer to borrow  to transport the tractor? When would it be possible to schedule an appointment?
