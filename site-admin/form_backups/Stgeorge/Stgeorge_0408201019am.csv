"2","Paul","Soda","khp78@yahoo.com","9703426690","Hello,
I'm new to the area and came across your site and have a quick question I hope you can answer.

I've got a small business and looking into getting a government contract for landscaping that would require purchase of multiple larger tractors, mid size tractors, ztr mowers, and likely several other equipment items to expand my service abilities.

My question is, if I needed those items to ramp up my equipment needs quickly, how soon would I be able to get them from purchase to job site. Do you have equipment on hand for immediate sale and delivery?

I will likely have further questions, but thank you for now.
