I am preparing a possible civil suit against Blanchard Equipment Office located in Saint Matthews, SC. I have been treated badly by the service manager at that location (Ronnie Watkins) after questioning a bill that I received for work done to my lawn mower (invoice number: 1428397). Mr. Watkins was unprofessional and did not treat me the way a LONG TIME John Deere customer should have been treated. My lawn mower is still not fixed or running, and I am now stuck with a $536.91 bill that your company refuses assist me with. I have lost time, money, and nearly my patience in dealing with this situation. I do not want this case to go to litigation, but I am prepared to if needed. I ask that someone from the corporate office contact me at 803-874-4724. Thank you in advance.","1571860196","true","new",
"6","Cornelia","Taylor","btaylors@bellsouth.net","17066916817","Hi I'm reaching in Hope's to find a sponsor for Christmas. I am raising 4 grandchildren due to my daughters tragic death in Feb. 2012. They were very young when she passed ages 11, 5, 3 and 4 months old. We have had custody since her death, this is the first time in the almost 8 years we have ever had to ask for help. Every year since my daughters death we have sponsored 1,2 family's in her memory being Christmas was her most favorite Holiday. This year has hit us hard with some things. We feel more blessed than some with only $8,000 in dept and both vehicles having some major problems, however with 3 young ones ( oldest now 18 ) it sure seems like a lot. I have missed deadlines due to I never applied for help before, so here I am. Maybe the company are even some employees will be willing to help this year and we both on track for next year and can continue to pay forward. I'm gonna include there list, I just ask you realize I do not expect all on the list as some are expensive. Most are at walmart are amazon. Please understand you just cant write a letter to Santa without a list. So here is to praying.
Boys 8&10: nintendo Switch with accessories, NS game Mindcraft, 2 bikes 18" an 20 ", 2 gaming headphones with mic for ps4, Ps4 games NB2k19, gaming chair ( n ok t sure if this would require 2 chairs ) Nerf RL b li master with 2 rocked nerd missiles gun. 
Girl 13: Apple Smartwatch series 3, board game murder mystery with 4 locked rooms ( she loves mysteries ) there is a hard riddles for smart kids on amazon, tattoo markers ( so she will stop drawing on herself with permanent markers ) most are from walmart and amazon. This is what they have asked for. The 13 year old wants a North face zip up jacket black but it's not major. If you unable to help then maybe you willing to pass the email on to another company. I dont want to try and contact 5 companies and end of 2 helping and have double the same stuff. I also welcome more than anything grocery cards, grocery cards and more grocery, paper products such as toilet paper, papertowels, femine products, and paper plates.They growing kids and eat alot and USE alot. If nothing else please thank you for taking the time to read this email and hopefully we can get most these financial burdens off us this next coming year and back on track.
Thanks Taylor Family. ","1573062759","true","new",
