"7","Matthew","Douglas","Douglasmatthewc@yahoo.com","9126559288","Good afternoon, I am needing to get a few parts for a Gator. I was having some issues looking up particular parts for it and was hoping you could help.

Serial Number  - M0HX0PA011458
 
ModelNumber-      HPX Gator

PIN Number - M0HP4DX040843

Parts needing to be replaced are

---Both rear shock and Springs
---Alt Belt
---Dash Label Part number M152787 (if this is the correct one for the diesel )
---Breather ---Part Number M811569
Also need the front driveshaft from the rear too the front differential. The shaft on mine is broken or stripped under the gear handle. Its and a area where the rear shaft turns 45 deg. from the rear before it goes straight toward the front differential. I cant seem to figure these part numbers out online.


Thank you for any help you can assist me with. Pricing on the parts would be helpful also. Please fell free to call me with any questions.
