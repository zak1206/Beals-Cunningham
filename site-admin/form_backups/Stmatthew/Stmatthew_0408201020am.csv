Good afternoon
We are a company from Argentina and we are interested in the cotton harvester John Deere 9976 published on the website for US $ 29,500
We want to know some details:
1-Is it in optimal conditions to work or does it have to be repaired to put it into operation?
2-It's Pro-12 or Pro-16
3-Is it 6 rows?
4-Can you quote the equipment including shipping to the nearest port?

To the await of a prompt answer, I send you my most cordial greetings

Moisés Cura
