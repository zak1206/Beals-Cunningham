I am sorry I was busy at the time, but I did get the serial number  you requested.  My problem, though, is that what I found had only 13 figures and not 17 as you mentioned.  I found it on the side of the engine, the ONLY one I found and I went over the entire tractor looking for another one.  Anyway, what I found was *CH30430217765* and a model number of 3T80J.  I hope that helps.  If not, please let me know.  As you probably guessed, I am very busy between 7:00 am and 5:00 pm Monday through Friday.  I DO plan to come by your business this Saturday morning.  I am interested in getting another tractor, this one a little larger than the 850.  I need a front end loader on it, most because I need something that I can use to move large round bales of hay for my horses.  Thanks again for any help or information you can give me.

"31","Mike","McAteer","mike@mcateer.comcastbiz.net","706-825-1634","I have a dispute with the service I received yesterday.  My wife called last week to schedule a service for our John Deer mower.  We were most concerned with getting the blades replaced, which we knew to be in terrible condition.  She received a call Monday the 18th saying that the spindles on the mower needed to be replaced as well as the seat.  The total for all of the repairs she quoted was close to $600 dollars (including the $170 service fee).  I'm not sure the blades were mentioned, which I thought to be included in the standard service.  After considering that the mower was only 2 years old, I called back and said that I did not want to replace the spindles or the seat; that I only wanted the service we had asked for.  Again, when calling to set up the service, my wife specified that we wanted the blades replaced.  When your representative picked up the mower, she specified that we wanted the blades replaced.  When the mower was returned to us, the blades had not been replaced.  When questioned, your service manager responded that I had refused anything other than the standard service.  I would never contracted for your service had I known the blades would not be replaced.  Again, that was the reason I scheduled the service in the first place.  Since your service manager did not seem to want to discuss any of my concerns, I cancelled the payment on the check we had given your representative.  It's not that I don't want to pay your service fee, but I am not at all satisfied with the service I received.  I look forward to discussing this matter with someone who is willing to listen to my concerns.  I am currently working night shift for but will be available weekdays from 3 to 3:30 PM.  Thank You,
