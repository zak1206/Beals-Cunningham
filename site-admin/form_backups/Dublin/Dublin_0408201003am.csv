I have a 2005 Toro Z420, timecutter, that has been a awesome machine with no problems.  It has mulching blades, regular blades and bagger for grass cutting.  Reason for the new machine;  I have cancer and my wife can not and will not operate a zero turn (go figure...I love them).  Someday in the next year or so, I will have to depend on her to cut the grass.

"20","Aaron","Rogers ","aaron4lee5rogers@gmail.com","4782135300","Good afternoon,
    My name is Aaron Rogers, I'm 18 years old and have lived in Bleckley County all of my life. I graduated from Bleckley County High School May 25, 2019, with special recognition all four years in Agriculture. 
  From a very young age, I have had a great interest in mechanics. At home, I'm always working on a truck, car, lawn mower, tractor, chainsaw, weed eater, etc... I love learning what makes machines run and investigating and solving the problem as to why they dont.
  My hope for my future is to become a diesel mechanic; with even higher hopes of being a diesel mechanic for John Deere.
  At this time, I am searching for gainful employment with your company. I feel that this opportunity will give me the much needed training to further pursue my dream of becoming a diesel mechanic.
  Thank you so much for time and consideration.

Sincerely, 
Aaron Rogers","1560206644","true","new",

"22","Joey","parker","jparker@pakglobal.com","7068941444","The Trailer Troll trailer accessory we manufacture ourselves, It has a really good wholesale price and reasonable suggested retail If you choose to stock any or not, we can up ship them directly to you or the customer,  We can send you a nice banner to hang on a model trailer in your yard or hang on the chain link fence if you have one, some brochures for your counter. we have been in the manufacturing business for forty plus years.  The wholesale prices leave you comfortable room to make a decent profit. so far it has been a hit with homeowners as well as the landscaping guys. So the biggest risk is losing a small space to a banner or some brochures laying on the counter. I look forward to working with you any way I can.

I am looking for one that is sturdy enough to hit a stump or large root and not damage anything. I only have to rear remotes on my tractor so I would need it to be hydraulic controlled for the angle and tilt functions with manual offset. Haven't decided on which blade to get, just comparing for now.
