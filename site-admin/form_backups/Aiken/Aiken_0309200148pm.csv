. Rob, you have me scheduled to pick up my mower tomorrow morning and the new PTO switch is in the drink holder of the mower since that didn't fix it.  With a call I'll leave the mower near the road so easier to be picked up.
In spite of being 86 with bad knees, I did get down and check the belts and took pictures. However, I think the belts are fine. The problem I believe is either in the wiring or what the PTO wiring goes to that makes a click when the PTO is pulled out. If that is something simple, perhaps your pickup man could bring a part and see if he can correct it while here. 
As I said, I have bad knees and the grass is over due for mowing now. If I can't use the riding mower I may try my walk behind mower but doubt I can manage it. I'm scheduled to see an Orthopedic Surgeon for my knees this coming week.
