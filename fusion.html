                        <p class="gb-headline gb-headline-9ef8539f gb-headline-text">Superior’s modular platform systems offer bulk producers a faster, more economical solution to developing and commissioning a new processing plant. The scalable, pre-engineered systems can also be applied as additions to existing plants.
                            <br><br>
                            Modular platforms are compact for smaller footprints, offer convenient maintenance features and integrate seamlessly with Superior’s crushing, screening, washing and conveying products.
                            <br><br>
                            Modularity of design means owners and operators can easily expand the capabilities of their Fusion Platform System as finances allow, application needs change and alongside growing market conditions.
                            <br><br>
                            Additionally, choosing a pre-engineered configuration means faster lead times and earlier commissioning. Each system is designed with plug and play, pre-wired electrical connections and is optimized for efficient shipping by flatbed or container.
